# Sheridan-Data-Analytics
This repo contains personal data analytics labs and group projects that I did while doing my graduate program in IoT and Machine Intelligence at Sheridan College, Ontario, Canada.

As the team leader, I helped organize and coordinate the group to achieve timely and successful execution of the two projects. I also designed the PowerPoint presentations for the two projects by myself while contributing my technical coding and debugging skills.
